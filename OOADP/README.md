# **HOW TO EXECUTE**

### **Setting the directory**
Change the directory in your terminal to one directory outside where all the files exist.

Example:

If your java files are in ```C:\college\6thSemIse\OOADP\adapter```

Change your directory to ```C:\college\6thSemIse\OOADP```

This can be done by opening a terminal in the directory where all your code exists, and simply typing ```cd ..```

To ensure you are in the right directory, type

```ls``` (on linux or macos)

or ```dir``` (on windows)

And you should see your folder name listed, and **none of your java files.**

### **Executing**
Once in the right directory, type the following commands

```javac folder_name/filename.java```

Example: ```javac adapter/AdapterDemo.java```

Your code compiles here.

Next, type ```java folder_name/filename```

Example: ```java adapter/AdapterDemo```

And you should see your output!
